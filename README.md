>Before, Checking my website. Please check my all Potfolios with Chorme and this website is based on 1440px :) 




## The reason I tried to change this website. 

### üìçhttps://www.twosome.co.kr:7009/main.asp 
> This is original twosome place website 

1. Using layout inefficiently

2. Not user-friendly design

3. Even though their having own colors but couldn't use it on the website. 


## I tried to change like this. 

1. Trying to design the layout for full-screen to see it better 

2. Trying to design to see the information better way 

3. Trying to using all their representative colors to emphasize their indentity

4. Using geometric shape to make it vibrant

5. To make it user-friendly, I tried to design / code for responsive webpage 


## What I change in code 

As you can see this original website is not a responsive webpage so I tried to make it responsive webpage 
for who doesn't want to download special app for this but still want to check it out on their mobile phone.
