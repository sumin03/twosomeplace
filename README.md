>Before, Checking my website. Please check my all Potfolios with Chorme and this website is based on 1440px :) 




## The reason I tried to change this website. 

### 📍https://www.twosome.co.kr:7009/main.asp 
> This is original twosome place website 

1. Using layout inefficiently

2. Not user-friendly design

3. Even though their having own colors but couldn't use it on the website. 


## I tried to change like this. 

1. Trying to design the layout for full-screen to see it better 

2. Trying to design to see the information better way 

3. Trying to using all their representative colors to emphasize their indentity

4. Using geometric shape to make it vibrant

5. To make it user-friendly, I tried to design / code for responsive webpage 


## What I change in code 

As you can see this original website is not a responsive webpage so I tried to make it responsive webpage 
for who doesn't want to download special app for this but still want to check it out on their mobile phone.

So After studying **':root'** element so I changed it like this

Can you see the differences? 
If you want to see more check my css history on my github! 




## What I like the most on my website 

1. When it is become mobile webpage, I changed **recommendation part** with the slider but I wanted to give differences with others page.
So I made this slider up & down. so you can swipe it from the top to down. 
and when you hover it, You can see different options that gives you more information about that menu.

2. I twisted the layout little bit on the event part to give more fun! to users. 
As you can see, normal website use the layour normal way, but I wanted to give more fun! so try to put the element different way.

3. I always cannot stand the website doesn't look beautiful or ineffcient. 
Original website, using a typical layout to show their beverage, so I changed like this 

<img width="416" alt="스크린샷 2021-02-09 오후 11 23 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77384682/107377146-fe5adc80-6b2d-11eb-92b4-6102d308dcd7.png">

I gave same geometric shape with the main page, So you can feel **unity** on this webpage. <br>
And Thanks to those little icons, you can notice what I tried to give information about this beverage. If you click this, you can see much more detail 
explanation about it. <br>
Also design **more button**, To see more information without messing up the webpage while you are using mobile phone. 



4. I used **flex-box** to transform the layout easily. 
It is very annoyed when you are using mobile phone but the layout is still suitable for the desktop screen.<br>
So I used **flex-box** for mobile user.

Thanks to flex-box I could change this layout very easily for mobile user
