## The reason I tried to change this website. 

### üìçhttps://www.twosome.co.kr:7009/main.asp 
> This is original twosome place website 

1. Using layout inefficiently

2. Not user-friendly design

3. Even though their having own colors but couldn't use it on the website. 


## I tried to change like this. 

1. Trying to design the layout for full-screen to see it better 

2. Trying to design to see the information better way 

3. Trying to using all their representative colors to emphasize their indentity

4. Using geometric shape to make it vibrant

5. To make it user-friendly, I tried to design / code for responsive webpage
